Based on Mechanic #22 from Sean Howard's 300 Mechanics site: http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=22

TO-DO
-----

- Try some top-down design, using the 300 mechanics for inspiration
- Develop something that will compile to the correct html5 application
- Different game screens = different views to be swapped out and loaded separately
- Optional sound, default muted. Use Howler.js?
